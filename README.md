Basic example of Google Vision API using php and composer

This is basic example Google Vision API. I used the We Detection in this project. Made this project using php and composer. Deployed this on my amazon server.

If you're using php with composer then it will really helpful to you. Just create your own "key.json" file from Google API service.
